# House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

## Description
This project predicts house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and bathrooms using multiple linear regression in Python. The model is trained and tested to evaluate its accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following columns:
- sqft
- bedrooms
- bathrooms
- price

## How to Run
1. Open the Jupyter notebook or Google Colab file.
2. Make sure `house_prices.csv` is in the same directory (or mount Drive if using Colab).
3. Run all cells to see the predictions and evaluation metrics.
